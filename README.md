<h1>Download Organizer</h1>
  A simple Python script that moves files in your downloads folder to created directories 
  in the Users Home Directory (~) and creates one if there is no home directory available.
  I use this to clean up and organize my downloads folder.
  
<h1>How to use</h1>

Simply install the document and run the script, and your downloads folder will be organized accordingly.
